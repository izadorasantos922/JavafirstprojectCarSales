I really like this task, so i decided to upload it to GitHub. My professor gave me this project with a lot of bugs, so I fixed it and returned the fixed version.

To run it on your machine, you need to have the JDK installed and have Java properly configured. To compile, type:

javac filename.java

Or you can compile all files at once with:

javac *.java

Then, simply type:

java Main

Have fun!
